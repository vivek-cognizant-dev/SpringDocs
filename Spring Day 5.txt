	6. There is no XML Configuration

@SpringBootApplication : internally works in a 3 ways
	It works as a
	1. @Configuartion
	2. @ComponentScan
	3. @EnableAutoConfiguration : look for all the JAR files in POM.xml and do auto configure

implements CommandLineRunner : Any task which I need to run before main method we put in CommandLineRunner
	It runs before Main method

implements ApplicationRunner : ApplicationRunner is another interface in Spring Boot that serves a similar purpose to CommandLineRunner, but it provides a more structured way to access and parse command-line arguments
