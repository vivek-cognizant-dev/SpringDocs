Spring Day 14

Load Balancing
Load Balancing is a feature to handle incoming traffic(user request) and make sure to distribute among n number of instances.

Resilience - It is a feature in spring cloud where if a microservice which gets consumed fails because of some reasons like exceptions, database failure or wrong url etc. then you have fallout method.

Gateway - It is a feature in cloud where all the microservices register in the eureka server must be routed through gateway so that all the microservices can have a common port instead of referring n numbers of port.


Defining the routes in the services

spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
      routes:
        - id: MS1
          uri: lb://MS1
          predicates:
            - Path=/producer/viewpay
 
        - id: MS2
          uri: lb://MS2
          predicates:
            - Path=/consumer/getpay
