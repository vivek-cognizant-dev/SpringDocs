Spring Day 4

AOP: Aspect Oriented Programming

AOP is basically cross cutting functionalities. 

AOP Terminology:
1. Concern: The functionality which need to be implemented
2. Cross-cutting: The functionality which need to be implemented through out the application
3. JoinPoint: It is an Area of execution where advice need to run
4. Advice: Its a course of action which need to be perform on joint point
	There are following types of advice: 
		1. Before - before the execution area
		2. After
		3. Around - In one advice only we want to run before and after advice
		4. AfterReturning - After the method is run successfully
		5. AfterThrowing - after the exception is thrown
5. PointCut - A set of JoinPoints



IMPORTANT

@Before("execution(public String *.*.*.get*())")   //this is called joinPoint
public void beforeAdvice() {
	System.out.println("Circle Before Advice");
}

@Before:
This annotation tells Spring AOP to run the advice before the matched method executes.

Pointcut Expression (execution(...)):

public String → Matches methods that return a String and are public.

*.*.*.get*() → Matches any method starting with get in any class, in any package (3 levels deep).

The first * → any package.

The second * → any class.

The third * → any method name starting with get.

() → no arguments.
