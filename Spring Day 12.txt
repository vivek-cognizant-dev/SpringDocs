Microservices - are nothing but small services which are deployed with its individual database in a different servers.

Scaling - Its is a feature where number of instances are increased or decreased of a given application
	
Monolithic							Microservices
- Single language						- Multiple Language
- Single Database						- Every service will have its own Database
- Fully Tested							- Only Service level tested
- Entire Application is deployed				- Only service level gets deployed
- Scaling is done for the entire application			- Scaling is done on specific service
-entire application need to be monitor				- Individually we need to monitor
								- If One microservice fails, it will not effect entire application

As microservices are distributed by nature so handling hardware and software is a big challenge. To maintain this we have got Spring Cloud enabled
	application.


It is the responsibility of spring cloud native application to maintain the hardware and software of the microservices
1. Elasticity - To increase or decrease the instances of the application
2. Resilence - means if one microservices falls down you must have some alternate features
3. Security - 
4. Load Balancing - is a feature to control the load given to the application and making sure that it is equally distributed among multiple instances.
